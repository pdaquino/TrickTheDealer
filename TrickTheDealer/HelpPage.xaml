Swiping sideways will show the expected number of drinks if the dealer says &quot;lower&quot; or &quot;higher&quot; (i.e. the conditional expectation). It's fun to try different aggressiveness levels and see how the expected number of drinks changes.&#xA;•&#x9;If you drag the highlighted middle card and drop it on another card, you can see what the optimal strategy is if the player starts by guessing that card.  For example, if the app says the optimal is to choose 9, but your friend guesses 3, you can see what the new optimal strategy looks like by dragging the highlight from 9 onto 3. You can also use this to see just how bad of a choice your friend made, by looking at the expected number of drinks (a number in parenthesis compares it to the optimal choice).&#xA;•&#x9;You can also do this drag-and-drop for the higher and lower card suggestions." />
